_A personal guide to refer while working on ROS `Noetic` and ROS2 `Humble`_

## ROS Noetic

### Manage your Environment 
First, source the ROS Noetic environment setup file. It's recommended to add this to your `.bashrc` file for automatic sourcing:
```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can choose to run this command on every new shell you open to have access to the ROS commands. This process allows you to install several ROS distributions (e.g. indigo and kinetic) on the same computer and switch between them.
> ```bash
> source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
> ```
